**THEORY:**

Series RLC circuits consist of a resistance, a capacitance and an inductance connected in series across an alternating supply. In a series RLC circuit containing a resistor, an inductor and a capacitor the source voltage Vin is the phasor sum made up of three components, VR, VL and VC with the current common to all three. Since the current is common to all three components it is used as the horizontal reference when constructing a voltage triangle.
The impedance of the circuit is the total opposition to the flow of current. For a series RLC circuit, and impedance triangle can be drawn by dividing each side of the voltage triangle by its current, I. The voltage drop across the resistive element is equal to I*R, the voltage across the two reactive elements is I*X = I*XL – I*XC while the source voltage is equal to I*Z. The angle between VS and I will be the phase angle, θ.
